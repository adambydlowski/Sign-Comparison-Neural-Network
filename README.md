# Sign Comparison Neural Network

## Project Objective
This project was completed as part of the Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course at Wrocław University of Science and Technology.

It aims to solve the following problem:
Consider a problem that takes as input two real numbers from the interval [−1, 1], different from zero, and returns a value of 1 if they have the same sign, or 0 otherwise.
Implement a backpropagation algorithm for this problem using a two-layer neural network containing four units in the hidden layer and one in the output layer.
Test your implementation on unnormalized data, data normalized using the L1 norm, and data normalized using the L2 norm, as well as using both the sigmoid and ReLU activation functions.
What is the learning rate, and how does it depend on the learning coefficient?

## Results
The results and code are included in the file network.ipynb.
